# ChainSubscription Hub

## Project Title

ChainSubscription Hub

## Project Description

ChainSubscription Hub is a decentralized smart contract platform to manage subscription plans and user subscriptions with automated renewals. Built using Soroban on the Stellar blockchain, it provides transparent management, enforcing subscription rules, renewal cycles, and pausing or canceling subscriptions securely and trustlessly.

## Project Vision

The vision of ChainSubscription Hub is to offer subscription-based businesses a decentralized, secure, and automated way to handle user subscriptions and renewals without relying on centralized intermediaries. This guarantees transparent access management and payment enforcement, increasing user trust and business reliability.

## Key Features

* **Plan Management:** Admins create and manage subscription plans specifying duration and pricing.
* **User Subscriptions:** Users can subscribe to plans with options to auto-renew.
* **Automated Renewal:** Subscriptions auto-renew based on duration and payment (payment logic external).
* **Subscription Cancellation:** Users can cancel subscriptions disabling immediate or future renewals.
* **Immutable Records:** All plans and subscription states recorded on-chain for auditability.
* **Access Control:** Admin-restricted plan management and user-restricted subscription control.
* **Transparent Status:** Publicly accessible subscription status and history.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Set Admin:** Deploy and assign admin for subscription management.
2. **Create Plans:** Admin adds subscription plans with name, price, and duration.
3. **Subscribe:** Users subscribe to plans and optionally enable auto-renew.
4. **Auto Renew:** Auto renew can be triggered by scheduler or user action.
5. **Cancel:** Users cancel subscriptions when desired.
6. **Query:** Anyone can query subscription details for transparency.

## Future Scope

* **Payment Integration:** Integrate Soroban tokens or off-chain payment oracles to enforce payments.
* **Multi-tier Subscriptions:** Support multi-level or bundled plans.
* **Trial Periods:** Add trial subscriptions and discount promo codes.
* **User Dashboards:** Build interfaces for users and admins to manage subscriptions.
* **Notification System:** Add alerts for renewals, cancellations, or payment failures.
* **Cross-Platform Sync:** Sync subscriptions between decentralized services.
* **Compliance Tools:** Automate tax and regulatory compliance reporting.

## Technology Stack

* Rust and Soroban SDK for secure smart contract development.
* Stellar blockchain for decentralized, immutable state management.
* Cryptographic signing and timestamping for secure subscription enforcement.
